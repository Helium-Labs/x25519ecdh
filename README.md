# X25519 Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) Messaging API

Provides a simple API for encrypting and decrypting messages between two parties with X25519 ECDH, making use of best practices and highly trusted crypto implementations.

⭐ Stars ⭐ and contributions are highly appreciated.

## Features

- Encrypt messages with X25519 ECDH derived shared secret
- Decrypt messages with X25519 ECDH derived shared secret

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install @gradian/x25519ecdh
```

## Usage

```javascript
import X25519ECDHMessageChannel from "@gradian/x25519ecdh"
import { generateX25519KeyPair } from "@gradian/x25519ecdh/util"

// Step 0: Exchange public keys (simulate a network transfer or other method of exchange)
const aliceKeys = generateX25519KeyPair();
const bobKeys = generateX25519KeyPair();

// Step 1: Two parties generate their own key pairs
const aliceChannel = new X25519ECDHMessageChannel(bobKeys.pub, aliceKeys); // Alice's message channel with her key pair
const bobChannel = new X25519ECDHMessageChannel(aliceKeys.pub, bobKeys); // Bob's message channel with his key pair

// Step 2: Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob
const encryptedPayloadFromAlice = await aliceChannel.encrypt("Hello, Bob!");

// Bob receives the encrypted payload from Alice and decrypts it
const decryptedPayloadByBob = await bobChannel.decrypt(encryptedPayloadFromAlice);
console.log(`Bob decrypted: ${decryptedPayloadByBob.unencryptedData}`);

// Step 3: Bob sends a reply back to Alice
const encryptedPayloadFromBob = await bobChannel.encrypt("Hi, Alice!");

// Alice receives the encrypted payload from Bob and decrypts it
const decryptedPayloadByAlice = await aliceChannel.decrypt(encryptedPayloadFromBob);
console.log(`Alice decrypted: ${decryptedPayloadByAlice.unencryptedData}`);
```

## Todo

Currently there's no way to verify who sent a given message, so a good todo is:

- Add message sender authentication with DSA

## Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
